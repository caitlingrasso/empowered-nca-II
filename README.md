## Selection for short-term empowerment accelerates the evolution of homeostatic neural cellular automata


Notes: 
- 'error' is the name of the loss metric and 'MI' is the name of the empowerment metric. Thus, runs labeled 'error_MI' in the code are called tri-loss-empowerment runs in the paper (tri-objective search with the first objective as age, the second as loss, and the third as empowerment)
