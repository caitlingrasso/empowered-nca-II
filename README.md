## Structure

## Experiments

### Notes: 
1. `error` is the name of the loss metric and `MI` is the name of the empowerment metric. Thus, runs labeled `error_MI` in the code are called tri-loss-empowerment runs in the paper (tri-objective search with the first objective as age, the second as loss, and the third as empowerment)
